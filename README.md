## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My biggest challenge initially was working with a bad computer at my campus's library. Fortunately, with help from other
programmers, I was able to do this project on my laptop. I had trouble figuring out how to load and save and how to correctly implement the settings bar button item. When I went online, it was sometimes very confusing to read other examples and watch videos. I just had to use Google for the Bar Button item and I also spoke with other programmers to correctly load and save the data on the settings page.
